Pros:


-Works a lot better than any OTC (throw that junk out waste of $)


-Cheap...compared to other drugs


-Fast acting ...even if caught later will still work


-Can stop/reduce symptoms


-Convenient vs any cream


-Side affects nothing like Famvir





Cons:


-Not as good as Famvir(holy grail to knockout cold sores)


-It appears you need to double the dose to really get an affect


-Maybe slight headache


-You need to take a lot, its not just 3 pills and done...


-no advancement in this drug and its been around for how long??

My problem is that I have taken 30 mg a day for 11 years and it just does not work anymore. I can&#039;t get a higher dose or a change that might help because its something new. It helped at first but I just want to stay home and do nothing. I feel hopeless for the future and just don&#039;t know what to do .

34634,"My GP prescribed this drug to me to help me sleep as I have Borderline personality disorder and OCD.

I was to take 1 tablet a couple hours before bedtime; I done just that.



Within an hour, I started to feel slightly paralyzed and severely slow like a sloth. By two hours I wasn&#039;t able to properly hold a sentence without slurring. I went to bed and felt like I fell asleep instantly.



The next morning on the School run I was completely unable to get up. My child stayed home and watched tv next to me whilst I slept until 12pm. I awoke feeling severely slow and like I had severe depression. The effects lasted until the next morning.



Anyhow I took half a tablet a week later and the same effects were there but not as severe.

Then I went home and read reviews. Everyone is warning about this INTENSE and HORRIBLE burning and itching they felt which actually made me hold off for a few days. If you do not have a diagnosed YI then this is going to BURN. Otherwise it&#039;s is going work like a charm. About ten minutes after putting this in before bed, I did feel a little bit of itching but not even enough to want to scratch. I fell asleep within 15 minutes and slept through the night. I had a diagnosed YI. I had NO BURNING. I had very little itching.

When I went to the orthopedic Dr he told me I was bone on bone and a candidate for knee surgery.  I am 68 yrs old, very active and have never been overweight, I was shocked at the diagnosis.  Cortisone gave me no relief.  Starting in March I had one injection for 4 weeks, with minimal relief.  A month after the last shot (middle of May) I got out of bed with 90% relief and a bit more improvement for 5 to 6 days.  It is now 5 months and I am almost pain free!
