At night, its the same routine except a different topical. I am also taking an antibiotic twice a day every day. Last year, my acne WAS TERRIBLE. I was so insecure about it. The topicals and antibiotics helped, but very slowly. It&#039;s been over a year and my acne is still very bad. I have not missed one day of doing my routine morning and night, so I am growing impatient. I have done it for over a year and its so little improving my face. I also get chemcial peels every month to help the breakouts coming in. Terrible.",-1,0.001794963,0.947136,1,Clindamycin,Acne,31-May-16,14,2,another drug mentioned,

I&#039;ve always had at least a modicum of improvement and sometimes even  success with these various fillers.  However, when I finally decided after two years of research to go ahead and have Bellafill injected to one area of my face where there are acne scars, I wound up with absolutely no visible or palpable evidence that Bellafill was even in my face.

Began initial dose at 2230 hours. Felt the medicine working within a &frac12; hour. Was in a good mood as I had been taken off of Warfarin this date. Before drifting off to sleep, I glanced at the clock. It was approx. 2300 hrs. I had an odd feeling in my throat that was possibly closing up. I remember worrying what is going on here? As the feeling in my throat persisted, I also felt my &ldquo;Adam&rsquo;s apple&rdquo; fluttering and an elevated heart rate. I soon fell asleep. No other meds taken except for Atorvastatin.





&bull;	20 Apr. 2016  





I awoke a 0600 hours to go to the bathroom. Upon arising, I felt a damp spot at the back of my underwear. Pulled the sheets back a discovered I had Shit the bed in my sleep. Felt real dizzy and drowsy. Thought to myself &ldquo;how &amp; why?&rdquo; this happened. Went to shower.





As the morning continued on at 0630, the side effects were evident:


1.	&ldquo;Hot flashes&rdquo; Absolutely miserable. Could not get / stay comfortable. Firstly, had the flushing sweats, then I would get too cold. Turning off the air conditioner and fan for about a half an hour, Becoming hot again. This has continued on and has not stopped. Extremely bad migraines as well since waking and did not let up at all. Sensitive to noise, light and sounds.


2.	The same feeling in my throat upon waking, I drank water to cool off and see if this would stop. And it didn&rsquo;t.


3.	My face was tingling all over as well.


4.	Moderately nauseous upon standing up or sitting down. The nausea had continued all day. Had a special K cereal bar to ease this up in the morning. Having only relief from it less than an hour.


5.	Tried eat cereal for lunch and discovered unable to eat it at all. The taste of it was making me sicker.


6.	Took two 500 mg acetaminophen at 0700, relief was only slight and the head aches returned less than two hours.


7.	Overall neck pain eased up and other arthritic symptoms did as well. I could definitley tell a difference, However the head ache did not.








8.	Decided to take a dosage during the morning at 1000 hrs. To avoid loss of bowel control in my sleep. Within about two hours, felt it working through my system. Same effects I mentioned as before. Severe headaches and Nausea all day. And of course unbearable hot &amp; cold feelings again thinking that these should eventually pass as I become used to it.


9.	Laid down from 1400 to 1700 to alleviate the symptoms. Awoke from the nap and tried to eat dinner. One bite made me sick to my stomach. Headaches still there. 


10.	Overall, felt the same until bedtime as I did all day. Will give it one more try tomorrow morning.


Did not take any meds except Atorvastatin, and two acetaminophen.

I couldn&#039;t stand, sit, walk, lie down, or any other activity without terrible pain up and down the back of my left leg. I was tested for everything including MRI and using novocaine and other pain killers. Nothing helped. After 5 months of constant pain, my doctor suggested discontinuing Crestor. The pain was completely gone within a week. Come to find out, my Sciatic nerve passed through my Piriformis muscle instead of around it like in most people. The Crestor had caused toxicity in the Piriformis muscle  which caused it to squeeze the Sciatic nerve continuously, causing continuous pain.",-1,0.000243127,0.9992052,1,Crestor,High Cholesterol,11-Dec-16,75,3,,
